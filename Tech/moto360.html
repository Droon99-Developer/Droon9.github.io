                    <p>When it comes to wearables, fashion trumps function. That's the mantra Motorola went by when it designed and developed the Moto 360, and judging by the enthusiastic response the watch received when it was unveiled, plenty of people agree. But does it still hold up now, 2 years later? The Moto 360's claim to fame is that it's the first Android Wear device with a round face. And that was a big deal. When compared to the other two Android Wear watches it was released with, the Moto 360 looks the most like an actual timepiece partially due to that round design. Indeed, one of the reasons Motorola went with a circular design is that it believes a round face is simply more watch-like. Now however, the market is full of the circular design. Does the 360 offer enough to draw you away from a newer watch?</p>

                    </div>
<p>That thought process included not just the shape of the watch, but also the materials used to make it. The housing is constructed from glass and stainless steel and the metal bands, though small for my wrist, fit the design perfectly. There was a small thing that didn't quite fit the perfection though namely the rather noticeable black slice at the bottom, oft called a "flat tire," that mars the display's circular perfection. Motorola says that in order to maximize the screen size of a small and round display, it opted to house the watch's display drivers and ambient light sensor in that little wedge instead of creating a thick circular bezel. If that is indeed the trade-off, I agree that the edge-to-edge chamfered glass is a better option. But if you're even the slightest bit of a perfectionist, that flat tire might be difficult to un-see.</p>

<p>The watch charges wirelessly in a provided cradle. It uses the Qi standard to charge,the same as the Nexus 7, and in my experience takes a bit over an hour to hit 100% though your mileage may vary. As it is an Android Wear watch, it does everything Android Wear 1.0 devices can do. This consists mostly of notifications, checking the time and weather, and the occasional app or game. It's not really a super complex device.</p>

<p>Now the elephant in the room. The Moto 360 will not be getting the Android Wear 2.0 software, which adds much improved functionality. Without this update, I struggle recomending this watch to people. I was able to get mine for a steal from a friend, but unless you can manage to do the same, I would shell out the extra cash for either the Moto 360 Sport or Gen 2, both of which will be getting the Android Wear 2.0 update. </p>
