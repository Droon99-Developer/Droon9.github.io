Thanks to Apple deciding to be Apple, there is about to be a big spike in the number of headphone buyers looking to go wireless.  Unless you have been living under a rock for the past few weeks you will now know that the Iphone 7 no longer has a headphone jack.

With users scrambling to find the best headphones for the iPhone 7 it seems that Chinese rock star, Wang Feng, has come along at the right time with his FIIL Diva Pro model.  The Diva Pro is the flagship product from this new Chinese startup which has just started to roll out their global launch. Lets see how this Kickstarter product fares.</p>

<p><h3>THE CABLE</h3></p>

<p>FIIL go a little bit further than is the norm, this time in its cable design.  At first glance, it might look like an ordinary 3.5mm to 3.5mm connector cable with and inline remote but this one has a neat trick up its sleeve. Most people don't realise that in-line remote cables are usually made to work with either android or apple.  The connectors are not the same and as a result, if you, for instance, try to use an apple remote on an android device you might experience a loss of functionality.  If you look at the back side of the FIIL headphone cable you see a switch that allows you to use the cable in either Apple or Android mode.  It's not a deal breaker but definitely, solves the problem of compatibility so it's a very welcome addition. Other than that the cable is well built, relatively tangle free and has custom branded jacks at each end and was found to be fairly resistant to tangles throughout the review.</p>

<p><h3>TOUCH CONTROLS</h3></p>
<p>The Diva Pro has a touch control panel for playback as well as hard buttons for pairing bluetooth and activating the noise cancelling technology. The touch controls on the Diva Pro are located on the outside of the right earcup and allow users to control playback and volume.  It will take a day or so to get used to but after a couple of days and a few flights with these headphones I can say its one of those features I didn't know I wanted but am glad I do now.  By the swipe of a finger, I can lower volume or head to another track without having to reach into my bag or pocket to pull out my phone. </p>

                    <p><h3>THE BUILD QUALITY AND DESIGN</h3></p>
          <p>Build quality is excellent and the Diva Pro feel like a premium set of headphones.  They use a mix of high-quality plastics, aluminium, and soft synthetic leather and are devoid of any creaks or groans you get on cheaper headphones. The build feels rock solid.  This is most evident in the headband slide and folding mechanism that is traditionally a point of weakness in most portable headphones.  Here the headband slides like butter and remains locked in place when on the head without further need to fiddle with it during a listening session.  The folding arm is all metal with zero sign of future failings to come and can even be tightened by way of a torx screwdriver. The ear cups don't swivel but the ear pads and driver articulate to hug close to your head.  It's done in a way we have not seen before but its a nice touch and very well put together. The design is very sleek and very very small both on the head and also when packed up and folded away. Everything about them is streamlined simplicity and even though the Fiil Diva share a lot of features with the Parrot Zik 3.0 these are just a far better looking and feeling headphone. Being an on-ear headphone they were initially concerned about long term comfort but the combination of synthetic pads and memory foam put that to rest. When it comes time to put them away, the Fiil Diva pro, can of course, be thrown into the excellent included headphone case. However, our choice was to fold them up, as in the above picture and thow them in an even smaller case.  These headphones can fold up very, very small so that's another great thing for road warriors looking to save space when travelling. Branding is spot on simple and unobrustive, the ear cups are clearly marked with L and R markers and you get a choice of colours for the headphones when buying.   We have the white ones in and while not the biggest fan of white of glossy finishes that is a personal taste thing and they are still a good looking set of cans and you can also grab a set in matte black.</p>
          <p><h3>SOUND QUALITY</h3></p>

<p>The simplest way to put it is that the Fiil Diva Pro are roughly on a par with my own Bose QC35 noise cancelling headphones.  That is both with and without the ANC activated.  Both sound in the top tier of the best ANC and wireless headphones but don't expect them to compete with their wired bretheren just yet.

It's actually hard to write about the sound of the Fiil Diva Pro because they can really sound however you want.  The ability to tweak the EQ through your player of choice and then alter the soundstage and presence through the 3D sound tech means that the are extremely versatile in how they perform.

With all the settings turned to off but with aptx Bluetooth functionality turned on the sound very balanced and clear with a fairly balanced response.  the highs have some sparkle to them as you would expect with a headphone aimed predominantly at the Chines market.  This gives a good amount of detail in genres such as classical and Jazz but when paired with a solid punchy bass coming from the low end it will also compliment electronic genres.

The midrange is more average, what I would say is good, rather than great.  Again it's hard not to compare it to the mids of wired headphones but against other Bluetooth headphones, they are still reasonable good.  Something like the Noontec Zoro II HD Wireless model will be better than the Diva's on the mids and the same can be said about the Bose QC35 which are particularly strong in this frequency.

                      <div class="descleft">"Here the headband slides like butter and remains locked in place when on the head without further need to fiddle with it during a listening session."</div>
                    </div> The low end is punchy and has good depth but doesn't have a lot of speed to it.  Good for Hip-Hop and Electronic bass drops but not so much for Jazz and Classical.

                    While the above might sound pessimistic to some I again reiterate I am comparing these to wired audiophile headphones.  The Diva sound very good as do the Bose and less so the Parrots but on the wired headphones it is outstanding.  Rated purely on merit as a wireless / Bluetooth / Noise cancelling headphone these sound excellent.

                    The other thing about the sound is that the Diva Pro are massively receptive to EQing meaning you should be able to tweak them to your heart's content with a little knowledge of custom EQ settings.  I personally find that by giving a slight bump in the midrange and upper bass you can and having the 3D sound set to theatre mode then they really begin to shine.</p>



                  <p><h3>CONCLUSION - ONE OF THE BEST PAIRS OF NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES </h3></p>
                  <p>I say its one of the best because in a toss up with the Bose QC35 I would have a very hard time choosing between the two.  The Fiil has a whole lot of features that I really like and actually find functional.  The Bose on the other hand is Bose and they know exactly what they are doing when making a set of Noise cancelling headphones.

                    Looking at the Fiil Diva Pro on their own then I really like the way wireless headphones are going.  They are more feature rich than ever and with the Fiil you get the most advanced of them all.  Additionally, the sound is vastly improved over previous generations and with Apples decision to remove the headphone jack on the iphone 7 its more important than ever that companies like Fiil are pushing the boundaries in wireless headphone design. </p>
