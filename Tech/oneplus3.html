                      <p>To say I’m not – or wasn’t the biggest fan of OnePlus would be an understatement. Something about the broken promises, slow updates and the apparent lack of support didn’t quite appeal to me. The OnePlus 3 has changed that – and in short, I love this thing. When the OnePlus 3 was announced I was the furthest thing from being in the market for a new phone. Having purchased the Nexus 6P at launch I was not ready to drop even more money on a new device. However after 8 defective units, I was offered a refund on my 6P. So I took it, and decided to give OnePlus’ latest and greatest a chance. To give a bit of background, I paid $600 for a 64GB Graphite 6P without Nexus Protect, my OnePlus 3 cost $449, with a dash charging car adapter (more on that later) and an insurance plan. That’s $200 savings for arguably a better device, more accessories, and an insurance plan.
</p><h3> <p>The Ordering Process </p> </h3>
  <p>I live in America so the shipping time, as well as the price, was all factored into the order. I had no issues with OnePlus' shipping or their tracker, and the package arrived on time. It took about a week.</p>
  <p>Hardware</p>
<p>Upon opening the OnePlus 3’s box the first thing I noticed was just how well built it felt. The aluminum feels thick, and the device feels dense. It’s a level of build quality I’ve really ever only seen from the iPhone and premium HTC devices. One of my issues with my 6P was that despite the aluminum body, it still didn’t feel or sound extremely solid or dense. If I have one complaint about the hardware, it is the location of the buttons. Individually they are placed very well. However the volume rocker directly opposing the power button led to turning off the screen more often than I’d like.
The design of the OnePlus 3 is one that will not catch any eyes – at least not because it looks unique. It’s very basic slab design features everything typical of a modern unibody phones. This simple design however, is a huge part of what makes the OnePlus 3 so great. It has curves in all the right places allowing the phone to comfortably sit in your hand during use. Upon first blush one may not think that such a basic design could look and feel so good in person. Not to say it is perfect, however. In order to make the device this thin and comfortable in the hand OnePlus had to do what every other manufacturer does. Give it a camera hump. Now I’m not particularily against them if they are done right, but that is not the case here. Like many Samsung, HTC, and apple devices the hump is a single shape popping out of the device. This causes some wobbling when trying to use the device on a flat surface. In this case I think OEM’s have two other ways to do it, thicken out the device, or create a thicker top portion like the 6P. These designs allow the device to remain on the table without wobble. Aside from that are the antenna lines. These have never really bothered me, they’re simple black stripes flanking the top and bottom of the phone. As a personal preference I do actually like how these look on the device. They are far better than the weird dual line thing the iPhone 6S has going on, and way better than the curvy ones rumored for the iPhone 7.
Beyond that there are the little things, such as the USB-C port, with Dash Charging as well as the 3.5mm headphone jack – somehow now a feature in a smartphone. And the buttons, oh the buttons. I have to give OnePlus major props here, the button setup is by far the best I’ve seen on an Android device. The option to use the hardware or software buttons is one that I truly appreciate. Also, the fingerprint scanner is awesome. Not much more to say about that.</p>

                    <p>  Display</p>
  <p>The spark of much controversy around the OnePlus 3 has been it’s display. Now I have to say I’ve not got the best eye for accurate displays, and as such I haven’t had any issues with the display calibratin. Colors are punchy, blacks are black. There’s really not much to complain about here. But, if you have an eye for this kind of stuff, on Oxygen OS 3.2 and newer SRGB mode is in the developer settings. For me it just looks washed out and yellow, but your mileage may very depending on if you have an eye for bad colors. Then there is the resolution, at 1080P the pentile matrix display is definitely not the sharpest one on the market. That’s ok, however as at any normal distance the display looks plenty sharp. It is only when the user looks up close and personal that the “screen door effect” can be seen and may annoy you. In conclusion, it is a solid display with ample resolution for the screen size. It should also be noted that The Screen of the Oneplus 3 has a propensity for scraching. Buy a screen protector and you shouldn't have any problems</p>
  <p>Camera</p>
<p>  The camera on the OnePlus 3 has been one of the most confusing parts of it. My experience has led me to view it as a solid camera that when faced with difficult dynamic lighting – will sometimes have trouble. When the lighting is good, your photos will be good. However when faced with dramatically different lighting conditions auto mode often fails to correctly eliminate the scene. Often I find that it brightens lowlights and blows out the highlights, or darkens highlights causing the lowlights to be a muddy black mess. Video for me has been generally good. The image stabilization is definitely shaky at times, and artifacts do show up. However neither of these have really been a deal breaker as I’m not a huge video person anyway. For me the camera’s inconsistency has to be it’s biggest drawback. Sometimes it does an amazing job, other times it doesn’t. I guess at the end of the day that can be said about most smartphones, so I’d say it holds it’s own.</p>

                      </div> <p>Software, Performance and Battery</p>
<p>One of the most pleasantly surprising things about the OnePlus 3 was just how good OxygenOS 4 is. Coming from a nexus 6P the performance difference was very noticeable for me. This phone flies along handling absolutely anything you throw at it. One of my biggest qualms with the 6P’s software was the occasional hangs or jitters that can be seen throughout the software. I was very impressed to see none of that here. It looks and feels stock but as a number of useful features such as dark mode, rearranging quick toggles, the ability to select preferred buttons and making use of the profile switcher. The best part about this is the OS manages to do this all, very quickly and smoothly while still getting me anywhere between 4 and 6 hours of SOT at the end of the day. I can’t really ask for more.
Software updates are something OnePlus has not been good at in the past, and all I can really say here is in the time I’ve had the device I’ve gone from 3.1 to 4.0 It looks promising.
I’ll also add in this section that Dash Charging has been a godsend. Yes I hate that it requires ONE brick and ONE cable, but working together they’re amazing. I can regularily expect my almost dead phone to go to 100% in about an hour. I still charge overnight, but knowing that if I run low, I can get a lot of batter quick is comforting. The car adapter works just as fast, which is a miracle when you are on the go and only have 15 minutes to juice up. I am very happy with this feature</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The OnePlus 3 is a great phone – but you already knew that. The reality is OnePlus has once again built a phone that competes with flagships, at a fraction of the price. There is no world where to me, the extra cost of the GS7, HTC 10 or LG G5 justifies itself over this device. However, it is noticeable that if you have a nexus, or the nexus line is of any interest to you I would recommend waiting. At the very least to see what Google’s latest has to offer.</p>
