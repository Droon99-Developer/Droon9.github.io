                    <p>If you are constantly on the go and plan to carry your computer with you, the Lenovo ThinkPad X220 has the features you are looking for. This laptop computer features a lightweight body, small display screen and fast performance. It includes a full feature set with a built-in webcam, microphone and several connectivity options. However, it lacks a large amount of memory.</p>

<p>The Lenovo ThinkPad X220 is designed for portability. This device features a 12.5-inch display screen, which is small compared to several similar devices but makes hauling the device around much easier. The display screen has 1366 x 768 pixel resolution, making the images crisp and sharp. Although this is not the highest pixel resolution we saw on a laptop, it is the same resolution you will find on many similar devices.</p>

<p>To further enhance portability, this laptop computer is lightweight, weighing a measly 2.9 pounds. You can carry this device with you on a constant basis without causing any burdens. It is 1.36 inches thick and 12 inches wide, which are small dimensions for a laptop computer.</p>

<p>One of the standout features on the Lenovo ThinkPad X220 is the fast performance this device provides. Using the Intel Core i5-2410M processor, you will experience speeds up to 2.3GHz. However, this processor also features Turbo Boost Technology that gives it a little extra performance. This laptop has Intel HD Graphics 3000 so your graphics run smoothly and are more enjoyable. Windows 7 Pro is the operating system included on this laptop.</p>

<p>You will find a full feature set on this laptop computer. A 720p HD webcam is included, along with dual microphones, which make video chatting and web conferencing possible on this laptop. This device offers several features ideal for video chats including a private chat mode. This eliminates background noise during a call. There is also a keyboard suppression feature that lowers the noise made from typing on the keys during video calls.</p>

<p>There are several ports and slots located on the laptop including three USB ports, an SD card reader, a 54mm express card reader and a combo port for both a microphone and a headphone. This device also has Hard Disk Drive Retention, which will secure the hard drive if the laptop falls. This security feature is a must-have to protect your hard drive and all the information you store within it.</p>

<p>The ThinkPad X220 doesnâ€™t offer a large amount of memory. It features 2GB of RAM and 320GB of hard drive memory. This certainly is not the lowest amount of memory you will find on a laptop but is on the lower end of the spectrum. However, this computing device features up to eight hours of battery life on a single charge. This amount of battery life will differ depending on your use and configuration of the laptop but it should still be plenty of life to accomplish the tasks you do on your computer.</p>

<p>There is a one-year warranty offered with the Lenovo ThinkPad X220. If any questions or technical problems occur while using this device, you can contact a Lenovo customer service representative through email, phone or live chat support. There is a user forum available on the Lenovo website for additional assistance and feedback from other users. You can also download drivers and software from a section of the Lenovo website.
