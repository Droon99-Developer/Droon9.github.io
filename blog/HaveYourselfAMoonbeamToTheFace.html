                          <p>I’m going to make this short if I can. I have to write my entire college essay so… yeah.</p>
                          <hr />
                          <p> So… the campaign I run afterschool got started today, and I’ll be honest, I legitimately have no idea anyone’s character names. There are five players, one was sick today, so I was dealing with an even four. We had a Dragonborn Wizard, a Goliath Palidan, an Aarakocra Gunslinger [abs], and Tiefling Warlock Twins. Right off the bat, not exactly amazing party composition. The political standpoint isn’t really the problem as they are in a fairly horrifying war, but their Healing Capabilities are 15 points of Lay on Hands from our Goliath, and Spare the Dying spam from one of the Warlocks. (I may try to push him to multiclass into Sorcerer, and his twin into Bard just to try to fix some of the issues. Spare the Dying spam would be so effective with Sorcerer points.) Anyway, High Damage Party isn’t a bad thing per se, it’s just that my other campaign is also extremely high damage, but more on them later. They entered Midpoint, my campaign starter city, and it was a refugee hell. They thought it was a cool setting, and went to the tavern owned by our resident demigod, Droon Fyreblood. One of the twins proceeded to insult the demigod, initiating a power word stun. He treats the rest of the party to an effect I call “truespeak,” where he essentially talked in giant and draconic at once. They were told the new overseer would be in the next day with some work, and the party slept and returned to find a Gold Dragonborn, named Rodrick. Rodrick loudly bragged about how he killed the former overseer, and the Dragonborn Wizard passed an insight check that and noticed his smile didn’t quite reach his eyes. They were tasked with clearing a ravine full of bandits. They made haste to do so, and one of the Tieflings was noticed during reconnaissance. The battle was won with an extremely effective use of Moonbeam, another effective use of Crown of Madness, and a well-placed scorching rays. They earned Kobold Fight Club’s recommended XP amount. I’m going to go write a college essay now. Have a good day people.</p>
