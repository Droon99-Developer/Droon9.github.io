          <p class="center-align light">Cell phone addiction acts much like other addictions but with the focus of the addiction being on phones and technology instead of other stimuli such as drugs and alcohol. But in short, it is the strong urge to use your cell phone or device while negatively impacting your life and or the people around you.</p>

          <p class="center-align light">The effects of cellphone addiction include insomnia, caused by use of cellphones at night, studies by Michigan State University have shown that late night phone usage causes people to be less active and have less energy throughout the day. Cell phone usage can also cause the prevention of the release of melatonin which is the sleep hormone and can be one of the causes of insomnia that may follow with addiction. Stress can also be an effect of cellphone use as there could be little difference between work and play as you can almost always be contacted by your work since your phone is constantly glued to your side which can lead to increased levels of stress.

          <p class="center-align light">We obtained 43 responses the majority of which were from Sophomores and Juniors. Of our 43 responses the majority of the subjects responded with looking at their phone for a text zero to five times per class period. Also, a majority of subjects responded with having their phones out of arm's reach for 21+ minutes. Nearly the same majority as the previous findings do sleep with their phone. Only 23.3% responded with feeling stressed without their phones but 30% responded with possibly feeling stressed about not being with their phones. The majority of the people who said yes said that their main concern about not being connected to their phone was losing the actual phone and not missing a text or message from someone/ something</p>

          <p class="center-align light">Ways of helping to avoid and control the addiction can include but are not limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>Limiting phone use each day by setting timers and locks on your phone</li>
<li>Taking a break from using technology by going camping or on vacation to areas without access to technology</li>
<li>Removing yourself from social media </li>
<li>Deleting games that you may play on your device</li>
</ul>
These ideas are self help tips for someone who is aware they have an issue and is trying actively to stop and do not cover the full range of what is possible for people to utilize in their own treatment. Professional help is also recommended in order to treat the addiction as it may be tied to mental illness.
